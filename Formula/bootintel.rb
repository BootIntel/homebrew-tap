# Homebrew formula for the BootIntel CLI.
#
# Generated from the published GitHub release, not built from source: the
# release workflow already produces signed, checksummed binaries for every
# platform Homebrew cares about, and rebuilding here would only add a Rust
# toolchain requirement and a second thing that can differ from the release.
#
# On every version bump, update `version` and all four sha256 values from the
# SHA256SUMS artifact of the matching release. The values below are from
# https://github.com/BootIntel/cli/releases/download/cli-v0.9.0/SHA256SUMS
